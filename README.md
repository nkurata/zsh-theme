  - Behind remote status

## Installation

   Make sure you have Oh-My-Zsh installed. If not, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

2. **Download the Theme:**
   Save the theme file `minimal-os.zsh-theme` to the Oh-My-Zsh custom themes directory:

   ```sh
    curl -o $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/minimal-os.zsh-theme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nkurata/zsh-theme/main/minimal-os.zsh-theme
   ```

3. **Set the Theme:**
